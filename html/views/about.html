                I'm a systems engineer, AI architect, and lifelong student of human psychology, 
                attachment, and relationship dynamics. I build tools that help people think more clearly, 
                see themselves more honestly, and make better long-term decisions — especially in the areas 
                of <strong>dating, relationships, and personal growth</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                ReadyForUs exists because most people don't fail at relationships due to a lack of effort.
            </p>
            <ul class="about-list">
                <li>They don't understand themselves yet.</li>
                <li>They don't understand what they're actually selecting for.</li>
                <li>They don't see the patterns they're repeating.</li>
                <li>And nobody ever helped them slow down and <strong>map reality before committing</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="about-mission">This project is my attempt to fix that.</p>

        <!-- Why Different Section -->
        <div class="about-card">
            <h2 class="about-section-title">✨ Why ReadyForUs Is Different</h2>
            <p>Most dating and relationship tools:</p>
            <ul class="about-list negative">
                <li>Push vibes over clarity</li>
                <li>Encourage premature bonding</li>
                <li>Avoid hard truths</li>
                <li>Or turn everything into shallow personality labels</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ReadyForUs does the opposite.</strong></p>
            <ul class="about-list positive">
                <li>Slow people down</li>
                <li>Surface real patterns and risks</li>
                <li>Identify misalignment early</li>
                <li>Help people understand <strong>themselves first</strong></li>
                <li>Then understand each other more honestly and safely</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="about-note">
                This is not about "optimizing" romance.<br>
                It's about <strong>reducing preventable suffering</strong>.

                <li>Clarity beats comfort.</li>
