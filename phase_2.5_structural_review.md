## Manifest Goals Alignment Analysis

### Stated Goals from Manifest

1. **Translate commitment into a workable day-to-day operating system** ✅
2. **Spot drift early** (expectations, effort, boundaries, communication, emotional safety) ✅
3. **Strengthen repair** (stress, rupture, reconnection handling) ✅
4. **Keep closeness intentional** (no mind-reading/guesswork) ✅
5. **Build a repeatable maintenance rhythm** (prevent preventable damage) ✅

## Question Type Distribution

| Type | Count | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| compound | 30 | Multi-field complex questions (timeline, feedback prefs, bids, repair) |
| single_select | 9 | Single-choice (what defined means, frequency patterns) |
| multi_select | 5 | Multiple areas (what's working, feedback responses, boundaries, life load, safety) |
| free_text | 4 | Open-ended (hard conversations, notes, other topics) |

**Assessment**: ✅ Appropriate mix

- Compound questions handle complexity without overwhelming
- Multi-selects capture multiple drift areas
- Free-text allows nuance

---

## Recommended Improvements

### Priority 1: Add Max Limits to Multi-Select Questions

**Why**: Prevents analysis paralysis and forces prioritization

**Questions to fix**:

1. `q06`: What's Working Right Now → `max: 7`
2. `q18`: Feedback responses → `max: 5`
3. `q22`: Boundaries during conflict → `max: 7`
4. `q37`: Life load areas → `max: 7`
5. `q44`: Safety check → `max: 5` (any more suggests serious problems)

### Priority 2: Consider Ranked Select for q08

**Current**: q08 (Fun and Friendship) is compound with dropdowns
**Suggestion**: Consider ranked_select for fun activities to force prioritization

**Rationale**: Helps couples identify TOP shared activities vs just listing many
